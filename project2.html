<p>
Toast your bread until nicely browned.  Slice each piece in half, then spread two of the halves with the peanut butter.  Place the banana slices on top, followed by the cherry slices.  Place the remaining half slices of toast on top, squash every thing down a bit so the peanut butter squidges out (be careful, the banana slices have a tendency to fly out at this point) and enjoy!</p>
