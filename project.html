<h3>Toasties</h3>
<p>Cheese sandwiches can be uncooked, or grilled so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts. A grilled cheese is often heated by placing the buttered slices of bread, with the cheese between the slices, on a frying pan or griddle.Another form of cooked cheese sandwich is the cheese toastie - a dish, particularly popular in the UK that is prepared by either baking or grilling a cheese sandwich in an oven.</p>

<h3>Bagels</h3>
<p>A bagel is a bread product originating in Poland, traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust.</p>
